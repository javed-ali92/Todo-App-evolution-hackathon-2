# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/sp.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: [e.g., Python 3.11, Swift 5.9, Rust 1.75 or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Primary Dependencies**: [e.g., FastAPI, UIKit, LLVM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Storage**: [if applicable, e.g., PostgreSQL, CoreData, files or N/A]  
**Testing**: [e.g., pytest, XCTest, cargo test or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Target Platform**: [e.g., Linux server, iOS 15+, WASM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Project Type**: [single/web/mobile - determines source structure]  
**Performance Goals**: [domain-specific, e.g., 1000 req/s, 10k lines/sec, 60 fps or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Constraints**: [domain-specific, e.g., <200ms p95, <100MB memory, offline-capable or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Scale/Scope**: [domain-specific, e.g., 10k users, 1M LOC, 50 screens or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

### Spec-Driven Development Compliance
- [ ] All development follows strict workflow: Write Spec → Generate Plan → Break into Tasks → Implement
- [ ] No direct implementation without approved specs, plans, and tasks

### Architecture Compliance
- [ ] Maintains monorepo structure: frontend/ (Next.js), backend/ (FastAPI), specs/, docker-compose.yml
- [ ] Clear separation between frontend and backend components

### Technology Stack Compliance
- [ ] Frontend uses Next.js 16+ (App Router), TypeScript, Better Auth
- [ ] Backend uses Python FastAPI, SQLModel ORM
- [ ] Database uses Neon Serverless PostgreSQL
- [ ] Authentication uses Better Auth with JWT

### Security Compliance
- [ ] All API routes require JWT token authentication
- [ ] Backend verifies JWT token and extracts user ID
- [ ] Backend compares token_user_id == url_user_id to prevent unauthorized access
- [ ] Users can only access their own tasks

### API Contract Compliance
- [ ] All API routes follow the specified contract:
  - GET /api/{user_id}/tasks
  - POST /api/{user_id}/tasks
  - GET /api/{user_id}/tasks/{id}
  - PUT /api/{user_id}/tasks/{id}
  - DELETE /api/{user_id}/tasks/{id}
  - PATCH /api/{user_id}/tasks/{id}/complete

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
